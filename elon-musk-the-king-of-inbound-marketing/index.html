<p>How come that so many people were present at the Model 3 launch, at the premise or online, but most of all placed their order for a new Tesla Model 3 even before seeing it or at least know the specs? Well, next to being a visionary and a entrepreneur who never, never gives up, Elon Musk knows how to captivate a crowd. And he knows how to tell a story, his story to start with. In April 2015 Elon Musk launched the 'powerwall', the Tesla home battery. Watching the event where he presented it, I was blown away by the story, by the reason why. When he presents a new tesla model, he uses almost the same story structure and brings a great story. Of course the products are awesome, the design is always special, the prices are... well not cheap and the waiting time to get your hands on one is long. But people are there, are interested, pre-order by the 10 thousands and are willing to wait for years to get one. </p><p>So why do I think he is the king of Inbound Marketing? He makes great products, explains well why he makes them and what he tries to achieve with them, he has passionate customers who are proud to own a Tesla product and they share their experiences -often by video-, Tesla is well present online and uses their channels intensively, their website rocks, they have nice & simple email newsletters you can subscribe to keeping you up to date and with every email add a zeste of 'I should really get one'. </p><p>In a nutshell: Make a great product (or service), tell a good story and explain the reason why, make sure your story gets heard, build your contactdata by inviting people to get your newsletters and/or invite them in following your channel(s) and contact them when they are ready to purchase. It's not rocket science and it works. </p><p>Serge De Munck, Inbound Marketer & passionate about technology and people.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">WorldOfWater</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
